# Spotify-API-Repo

In here I have included my Python code and documentation for creating the dataset of songs from Spotify.

The data was pulled from Spotify using their API. https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/

The table included has basic information about each song in the playlist. It also has information such as danceability, speechiness, and energy. This are variables created by Spotify used to create a deeper understanding of each song. It will be useful in further exploratory data analysis. 

I used the pandas and spotipy packages.
