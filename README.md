# Spotify-API-Repo

In here I have included my Python code and documentation for creating the dataset of songs from Spotify.

I have also included my EPA (Exploratory Data Analysis) python documentation! Hopefully this can allow you to follow along my work for creating visuals!

The data was pulled from Spotify using their API. https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/


The table included has basic information about each song in the playlist. It also has information such as danceability, speechiness, and energy. This are variables created by Spotify used to create a deeper understanding of each song. It will be useful in further exploratory data analysis. 


I used the pandas and spotipy packages.


The "greatest_hits_ever.csv" includes a table of the final dataset that I created.

The "Spotify Scraping Code.ipynb" includes all of my python code from this project, it excludes my own person API keys.

The "Spotify EPA Documentation.ipynb" includes all code for creating visuals.
